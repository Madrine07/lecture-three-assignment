// Primitive values are the basic building blocks of JavaScript. They are immutable,
// Meaning their values cannot be changed once created.
// When you assign a primitive value to a variable, the value is copied into the variable.
// The value can be fixed to a number, string, boolean, null, or undefined.

// WHILE

// Reference values, on the other hand, are objects that store a reference to a 
// value rather than the value itself. Objects, arrays or functions, are all reference types.
